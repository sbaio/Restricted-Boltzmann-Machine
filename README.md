# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine

In this project, we plan to discover deeply both theoretical and implementation aspects of the advances in RBM training.

We present an implementation of RBM totally in Python, and the results obtained. We also compare its performance with a deep learning library. (Theano)

## Requirement 

* Python2.7
* Numpy

## How to Run

```
$python RBM.py --help
```

## Training 

see Hinton's paper ([A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf))
