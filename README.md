# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine

In this project, we plan to discover deeply both theoretical and implementation aspects of RBM training.

We present our implementation of RBM totally in Python, and the results obtained. We also compare its performance with the tensorflow implementation of RBM from yadlt library (yet another deep learning tool).



## Requirement 

* Python2.7
* Numpy
In order to use the tensorflow implementation
* Tensorflow
* install yadlt through pip, and need to update some tensorflow methods in the implementation since these methods have been deprecated

## How to Run

```
$python RBM.py --help

In the Directory Code/RBM_yadlt/command_line/ run:
$python rbm_blackEcho.py
```

## Training 

see Hinton's paper ([A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf))
