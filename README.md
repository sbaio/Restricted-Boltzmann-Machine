# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine

In this project, we plan to discover deeply both theoretical and implementation aspects of RBM training.

We present our implementation of RBM totally in Python, and the results obtained. We also compare its performance with the tensorflow implementation of RBM from yadlt library (yet another deep learning tool).



## Requirement 

* Python2.7
* Numpy
In order to use the tensorflow implementation
* Tensorflow
* yadlt (see https://github.com/blackecho/Deep-Learning-TensorFlow or pip install yadlt)

## How to Run

```
$python RBM.py --help
```

## Training 

see Hinton's paper ([A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf))
